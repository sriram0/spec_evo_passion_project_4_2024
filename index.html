        <h2>What is Spec. Evo.?</h2>
        <p>
            Speculative Evolution is a sub-genre of science fiction dealing how life could evolve under different
            circumstances. There are many types of Speculative Evovlution, one of which is to speculate how life will
            evolve in the future on Earth. Another is rewriting Earth's history as if one of the major mass extinctions
            didn't happen, the most popular of which to replace are the <strong>Great Dying</strong> and <strong>K-Pg
                extinction</strong> events. A third main category is where you make up a <strong>habitable</strong>
            planet and bring a handful of Earth species to it and speculate how they evolve in the new enivronment. The
            final main kind of Spec. Evo. is where you create a habitable planet and imagine how life would evolve on
            it, completely independant of Earth. This category is the one I'm doing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your planets, as a rule, can't be too alien, because we just don't have enough information to know how life
            would evolve there. After all, Earth is only known instance of potential <strong>abiogenesis</strong> we
            know of. However, Xenoconatus, the planet I made, could certainly be a lot more alien. The only differences
            between it and Earth is the size of the star and the distance of the moon. Everything else, save continents
            (which aren't relevant yet anyway as, by the end of this, nothing has made landfall, which is expected, as
            we end this still in the <strong>Ediacaran</strong> equivalent), is really similar to Earth. I could've made
            it an iced-over rogue planet surviving off the heat of its dying core, or dwarf planet that has oceans of
            hydrogen-bromide and a millenium-long orbit, but I didn't, mainly because just about anything more alien
            would be hard for my intended audience to comprehend. Any sort of Spec. Evo. project is already a lot for
            someone that has little-to-know knowledge of evolutionary biology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even the greatest of Speculative Evolution projects don't cover ever single species that arises, because
            then we wouldn't even get past 5 million years. Most projects only showcase the notable species that are
            around at their designated 'present day' while only briefly mentioning their extinct ancestors. In this
            project, however, I will be showing every <em>major</em> <strong>macroscopic</strong> clade that arises on
            Xenoconatus, along with its founding species. This does not include <strong>plankton</strong> or
            single-celled organisms, which are far too numerous to catalogue, although they are what all visible clades
            evolved from and what many clades evolve back into, especially the early Planastomans. The absurd diversity
            of planktonic and microbial species is sommething I won't be unravelling here.

        <h2>The First 4 Billion Years</h2>
        <p>
            For those of you who've played it, this is the Bios: Genesis part. With a billion years, bacteria-like life
            establishes itself across the planet, taking over every square <strong>micron</strong> above and on
            Xenoconatus' surface. It took another billion years for something Eukaryote-like to appear before, and
            another 3 billion before the first multicellular organisms appeared. The first 'animals' diverged
            into two groups very early on, Planastoma and Ferontomorba. For much of Xenoconatian hisory, the
            Planastomans dominate, and the Planastomans are also the ones that we'll be following for a while after now.

        <h2><em>Planastomus protus</em></h2>
        <img src="planastomus_protus2.png">
        <p>
            This is among the first of the Xenoconatian fauna. Having appeared four billion years after the planet's
            creation, the descendants of this creature rapidly diversify to fill in the numerous vacant
            <strong>niches</strong>. <em>P. protus</em> and its early kin swim through clouds of
            <strong>plankton</strong> close to the ocean’s surface and grew no larger than 2 cm in length, yet were the
            largest living organisms of their time. From this original species descends the entire sub-kingdom
            Planastoma, the dominant Xenoconatians for aeons. It used its 'mouth', a flat regoin on top of the head, to
            catch as much plankton as possible. It tail is capable enough to move the creature closer to the surface
            where plankton is abundant, but it is unable to fight particularly strong currents, so <em>P. protus</em>
            barely lassified as <strong>nekton</strong>. Plently of its descendants abandon this and shrink down to join
            the zooplankton, but these species are so numerous and small that their evolution won't be discussed. Back
            to <em>Planastomus protus</em>, its rudimentary eyes help the creature differentiate between the darkness of
            the depths and the light of the shallows, so that the creature knows which way is up, the way the that most
            likely leads to plankton. This species lives for no longer than a year and a half.

        <p>
            Two million years after <em>P. protus</em> appeared, <em>Ammostomus verrunt</em> joins the mix, alongside
            many other new Planastomans. But this one is unique in that it isn't a <strong>filter feeder</strong>, but
            instead a <strong>benthic detritivore</strong>. This lifestyle was achieved by flipping the <strong>basal</strong>
            Planastoman body upside down, so that the mouth can sift through the ocean floor for something to scavenge.
            This species' tail is also stronger to be able to push it through sediment. This species is the common
            ancestor of the Xenoconatian infra-kingdom Ammostoma, a major clade in the history of the planet.

        <img src="tenalectus_magnus_2p.png">
        <p>
            Over the next 10 million years, Ammostomans specialise furthur into life on the ocean floor. Notable
            innovations include a horizontal, branching tail that pushes water through primitive gills in the first
            respiratory system Xenoconatus has ever seen. <em>Tenalectus magnus</em> was the most dervied Ammostoman of
            its time. It is the first on Xenoconatus to evolve things like two primitive hearts to pump blue,
            copper-based blood. The respiratory and circulatory systems combined fueled sizes of up to 60 cm in length,
            30 times the size of the original Ammostomans. This is the beginning of super-phylum Tenalecta.

        <p>
            Meanwhile, back in the water column, a new clade of Xenoeukaryota, the Xenoconatian equivalent of Earth's
            Eukaryotes, achieves multicellularity. This branch is descended from algae that became colonial.
            <em>Tristiphytus primum</em> floats on top of the water, catching sunlight from Xenoconatus' star. Due to
            the slight difference in mass, the star's spectrum is shifted to slightly shorter wavelengths, so instead of
            green and reddish-purple, the colours of Earth plants, Xenoconatians favour a blue (the background colour of
            this website) and an orange (the background of this slide). <em>T. primum</em> employs blue. It is mainly
            just a mat of blue algae, for now. It is the start of super-kingdom Tristiphyta.

        <img src="phycedulus_neoculus.png">
        <p>
            A new clade of Planastoman appears to take advantage of this new food source. The original Planastoman mouth
            moves from the top to the front and folds sligtly while the back of the mouth expands into a stomach-like
            cavity. The skin at the front of the mouth gains a <strong>calcium carbonate</strong> plate, to be able to
            bite off sections of the plant. The eyes also gain the ability to detect slight changes in light levels,
            which most likely mean <em>T. primum</em> is floating overhead. All of these adaptations are first found in
            <em>Phycedulus neoculus</em>, a species that appears 14 million years after <em>Planastomus protus</em> and
            is the ancestor of infra-kingdom Phycedula.

        <p>
            So far, one niche has been left vacant across Xenoconatus, that of the predator. But this isn't for long as
            a new clade of Phycedulans adapts to fill this niche. The tail is faster and longer, with more muscles
            attached in the base. This clade grows upto 5 cm in length and the mouth now folds fully, creating something
            a lot more like so many mouths on Earth. The CaCO<sub>3</sub> plate becomes sharper. Its eyes become fine
            tuned to detect movement and enlarge significantly. It gains red, iron based blood to keep up with the
            lifestyle of a hunter. <em>Acuvenatorus auctor</em> hunts both other Phyceldula species and basal
            Planastomans starting 3 million years after the appearance of <em>Phyceldulus neoculus</em>.

        <p>
            To counter this new predator, another clade of Phycedulan gains another calcium carbonate plate, protecting
            the top and sides of the head. To push this extra weight, the tail becomes more robust. To deal with a
            larger size and increasesd metabolism, this clade also gains green, iron-based blood. However, just like
            <em>A. auctor</em>, no heart is present. These features are all seen in <em>Thorapistis prokalo</em>, which
            first appears 2 million years after <em>Acuvenatorus auctor</em>. Its armour does not protect its tail,
            however, so Thorapistis' best defense is to face predators head-on, which it does if it sees anything of
            significant size approach it.

        <p>
            Meanwhile, the various Ammostoman branches continue to evolve, unaffected by <em>A. auctor</em>'s
            appearance. This clade diverged from the Tenalectans rather early on, before any of the specialisations to
            the lifestyle of a benthic detritivore. This lineage adapts its tail into an anchor and move its mouth to
            the front, like the Phycedulans above, although for a completely different reason. The entire creature faces
            forever upward, its branched tail buried into the ground to keep still. <em>Neoradicatus somnolentus</em>
            feeds on marine snow, the falling corpses of dead bacteria and plantkon from the water column above. The
            mouth has
            expanded significantly to a disc about 5 cm in diameter. This species has also made its eyes
            <strong>vestigial</strong>. However, larvae of this clade, like those of all current Planastomans, are
            free-living zooplankton.

            The Ferontomorbans finally make their move. Until now, they consisted of entirely planktonic species. Now, a
            clade has arisen that has a macroscopic adult form. This creature takes advantage of the abundant larger
            plantkon that are out of reach for the other Ferontomorbans, namely the larvae of Planastoman clades. Unlike
            the Planastomans, this species, <em>Neostomus provecta</em>, has a circular mouth. Other than that, it looks
            rather tadpole-like, apart from its three eyes.

            As Thorapistan species rise drastically in number across Xenoconatus' oceans, the original strategy of
            Acuvenator species no longer works. To counter this, a forked tail evolves, as well as switching from the
            ancestral <strong>subcarangiform</strong> to <strong>carangiform</strong> swimming. This increase in speed
            allows <em>Velopterygius mirum</em> to launch itself towards a Thorapistan's unprotected tail. With a set of
            four primitive hearts and two extra pairs eyes to aid in depth perception, <em>V. mirum</em> first appears 3

            Having a shape so similar to leeches on Earth, it didn't take long for a Neostoman clade to take up
            <strong>parasitism</strong>. All it required were serated <strong>chitin</strong> 'teeth' and the ability to
            metabolise blood. The Neostomans are the only clade with a <strong>through-gut</strong> and so have the most
            efficient digestive system on Xenoconatus. <em>Sanguitrogus parvum</em> has rather limited feeding options
            as not many clades have blood only 25 million years after <em>Planastomus protus</em> appeared.

            The Tenalectans, despite holding the crown for the largest living organisms on Xenoconatus for 13 million
            years, still have a larval stage vulnerable to predation by Neostomans. A way to solve this is by staying
            close to the ocean floor all their lives. The larvae, however, don't have tails strong enough to sift
            through sediment for detritus. Instead, like seahorses, they can adapt their tails to anchor themselves to
            rocks and feed like the Neoradicatans do. Because of the fact that the Tenalectan mouth faces downward, this
            creature, <em>Diverviatus paranxenos</em>, spends the entire juvelile stage upside-down. This change is

        <p>
            The Neostomans are not just an issue for the Tenalectans. All current Planastoman larvae are at threat of
            being devoured. This leads to the inevitable extinction of basal Planastoman species, like <em>P.
                protus</em>. Some of the larger filter feeders remain, just barely. One species of Acuvenator, however,
            simply lets its young be eaten. In fact, its young become even smaller than the three millimetres they
            currently are. Once inside the mouth of a Neostoman, the creature parasitically anchors itself to its
            Neostoman host. It feeds on the Neostoman's tissue until it dies, at which point the parasite does too. Some
            members of this lineage had larvae that develop into parasites if and only if Neostomans are around, like
            <em>Merotrogus thrikos</em>. These species still grow into predators when Neostomans aren't around. But the
            rise in Thorapistans and Velopterygians gives an incentive for some to take up parasitism full time, like
            <em>Soletrogus agrios</em>. Both of these species appear 30 million years after <em>P. protus</em>.

            muscle attachment. The creature becomes far flatter with a much more powerful tail. Its second heart, the
            one closer to the tail, grows in size significantly.
            <em>Sufflostomus ammos</em>, having evolved a stomach cavity, can easily prey on the miniscule basal
            Ammostomans and the Neoradicatans. The other Tenalectans, however are out of its reach for now.

        <h2><em>Veloflumen tachys</em></h2>
        <p>
            There are many places on Xenoconatus whose inhabitants are all microscopic. The land is yet to be invaded,
            the sky is still to be conquered, the deep ocean is due to be tamed, but freshwater lakes and rivers are the
            first to be taken by the Tenalectans. This branch diverged before the Diverviatans appeared, and so faced
            near-extinction from both the Neostomans and the Sufflostomans. To escape these threats, this branch quickly
            adapted to life on the riverbeds. The basal Ammostoman feeding style still works here and all that changes
            is that the new <em>Veloflumen tachys</em> is a third the size of its ancestors and is far faster. This
            species appeared 35 million years after <em>Planastomus protus</em>.

        <h2><em>Falsiphytus secunduo</em></h2>
        <p>
            A group of Neoradicatans evolves symbiosis with a species of unicellular orange algae. The algae live within
            the body of the Neoradicatan and provide their hosts with energy, allowing <em>Falsiphytus secunduo</em> to
            forgo feeding on marine snow an dlose its mouth altogether, getting by solely with the energy provided by
            its symbiont. Plant-animals like this also exist on Earth in some flatworms, except, of course, the algae
            are green and not orange. This species and its descendants quickly conquer the Xenoconatian oceans 4.039
            billion
            years after the planet's creation.

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            <strong>Abiogenesis</strong>: The proccess where living beings are created from non-living matter by pure
            chance. Abiogenesis has happened at least once, or you wouldn't be around to read this.<br>
            <strong>Basal</strong>: Original.<br>
            <strong>Benthic</strong>: Living on the ocean floor.<br>
            <strong>Calcium carbonate</strong>: CaCO<sub>3</sub>; a mineral used by many forms of marine life on Earth,
            mostly for building shells.<br>
            <strong>Carangiform</strong>: A style of swimming where the rear 1/3 of a creature's body is moved to
            contribute to thrust. This method is good for speed but has low manoeuvrability.<br>
            <strong>Chitin</strong>: The compound found in the exoskeletons of Earth's arthropods and and the cell walls
            of Earth's fungi.<br>
            <strong>Detritivore</strong>: Something that feeds on dead organic matter.<br>
            <strong>Ediacaran</strong>: A period in Earth's history from 635 to 541 million years ago that saw the
            diversification of the first animals.<br>
            <strong>Great Dying</strong>: A mass extinction event that occurred about 252 million years ago and was the
            most deadly one since the Cryogenian. It nearly eliminated the ruiling Synapsids of the time.<br>
            <strong>Habitable</strong>: (of a planet) A location where Earth-like life is possible.<br>
            <strong>K-Pg extinction</strong>: A mass extinction that occured 66 million years ago and wiped out the
            non-avian dinosaurs as well as many other clades.<br>
            <strong>Macroscopic</strong>: Anything large enough to be visible to the naked eye.<br>
            <strong>Micron</strong>: A millionth of a metre; a micrometre.<br>
            <strong>Nekton</strong>: Any aquatic lifeform that lives in the water column and is large enough to fight
            the currents.<br>
            <strong>Parasitism</strong>: The process where one species harms another for its own benefit.<br>
            <strong>Plankton</strong>: Any aquatic lifeform that lives in the water column but is too small to fight
            against the currents.<br>
            <strong>Subcarangiform</strong>: A style of swimming where the rear 2/3 of a creature's body is moved to
            contribute to thrust. This method isn't very fast but provides decent manoeuvrability.<br>
            <strong>Through-gut</strong>: A digestive tract.<br>
            <strong>Vestigial</strong>: Very small and no longer functioning; degenerate.<br>
